# Netflix OSS
A Microservice stack example using Netflix OSS

This code is based on the Book's implementation Spring MicroServices in Action (https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter7). The version of the spring boot was upgraded to 2.X.X and some other adjustments e.g. Redis to Oauth2 tokens, ELK, etc.
